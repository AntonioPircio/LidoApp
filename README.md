# LidoApp
Android App which simulates the management of a beach lido. 

Use cases are registration, logging in, account deletion, booking umbrellas and chairs, viewing reservations made, and changing passwords using an email and an OTP. 

The application manager will be able to look at each client's reservations.

The application uses ngrok to map the localhost to the internet allowing interaction with the backend.

The backend is located in the LidoWebServer repository and allows the Android application to use REST API to interact with a database.
